# Vinovoter
## Wine Tastings made easy!


## Installation Instructions

1. Download from github 
2. Move to /opt/vinovote (I'll fix this soon)
2. In the root, run 'make run' 

This starts a development webserver running the winetaster app.

To prepare  a list of wines go to 
`http://<your fqdn>:8000/admin/`
and login with the account created when you first started the server.
Any wine variety added will become a valid option during guest registration.
**Don't use Blended or Rose, no short codes have been assigned to them yet**
